# Initial Concept
Cortex: An AI-augmented workspace with persistent semantic memory and agentic capabilities.

# Product Guide: Cortex

## Vision
Cortex is an AI-augmented workspace built for solo developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious users who need a local-first, context-aware environment. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights by integrating semantic memory directly into the development workflow.

## Target Audience
- **Solo Developers:** Juggling multiple projects and complex contexts.
- **Students/Researchers:** Managing vast amounts of information and technical notes.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Demanding local execution and data sovereignty.

## Core Goals
- **Persistent Semantic Memory:** Reduce cognitive load by automatically surfacing relevant project context, notes, and code snippets.
- **Agentic Workflow:** Create a proactive environment where AI assistants help manage tasks, resolve errors, and automate repetitive workflows.
- **Local-First Sovereignty:** Ensure all core data remains on the user's machine, providing security and offline capability.

## Key Features
- **Smart Terminal:** A natural language shell integration (xterm.js) with real-time command capture and AI-driven error resolution.
- **Agentic IDE:** A CodeMirror-based editor with context-aware extensions, inline suggestions, and autonomous refactoring agents.
- **Knowledge Graph:** An automated entity extraction and auto-linking engine that visualizes relationships between code, tasks, and documentation.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Unobtrusive Design:** The AI should feel like a "sidecar" or a quiet partner, only surfacing when needed or requested.
- **Performance-First:** Latency is critical; UI transitions and semantic search must feel instantaneous to maintain flow.
