# Product Guidelines: Cortex

## Prose Style
- **Technical & Precise:** Documentation, UI labels, and AI responses should be direct, objective, and information-dense. Avoid fluff and prioritize clarity for a technical audience.

## Brand Persona
- **Agentic Peer:** Cortex is an intelligent collaborator. It shouldn't just be a tool; it should feel like a partner that understands the developer's context and proactively suggests improvements or identifies errors.

## UX & Interaction Principles
- **Keyboard-First:** All core actions should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts. The interface is optimized for power users who value speed.
- **Motion & Feedback:** Use reactive transitions and rich visual states to provide immediate feedback for all interactions. The UI should feel "alive" and responsive.
- **Hybrid Input:** While keyboard-centric, the system must gracefully support mouse-heavy workflows and terminal-based inputs to accommodate different developer preferences.

## Visual Design
- **Compact & Information-Rich:** Adhere to an IDE-like density. Maximize screen real estate to show relevant data, code, and terminal output without unnecessary whitespace.
